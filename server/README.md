# Introduction

The Endorsement Key (EK) based device onboarding is a mechanism to register a device on a cloud service using EK as device identity without the need to provision TPM with additional key or certificate. Moreover, it is possible to perform secure transfer of secret keys (HMAC/RSA/ECC) from a server to a deviceâ€™s TPM. Depending on the application, these keys can be used for different purposes, e.g., second layer data encryption/decryption.
